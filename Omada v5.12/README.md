# Home Assistant Omada Add-On
This add-on brings the Omada Controller directly into Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi and AMD64 platforms (NUC etc). 

This stable version is based on omada v5.12, while the current beta is at version 5.13 (beta). The beta channel has experimental support for AMD64 systems. Feedback is welcome!

# About this Add-On
This add-on is a fork of Matt Bentleys [docker-omada-cotroller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller)  would not have been possible without his excellent work. Other than in the original docker omada controller, this add-on stores all persistent data in the /data directory, so that it is compatible with Home assistant.
